    "`setigen` supports many ways of creating synthetic data.  This notebook showcases a small but practical subset of these techniques to emulate the data processed by the BLUSE Doppler drift search algorithm.\n",

    "## Simulating BLUSE data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The BLUSE commensal backend upchannelizes, beamforms, and doppler drift searches the data in situ using a unified software package called `seticore`.  We will be emulating some of the stages of `seticore` processing using `setigen` to generate simulated beamformer output and `turboSETI` to search for Doppler drifting signals.  This is a fairly close approximation to what the unified `seticore` package does, but `turboSETI` has been designed for *single pixel* (i.e. single dish, single beam) data so it does not support some of the more advanced RFI rejection techniques, such as *multibeam excision*.  As a workaround, we will fall back to using a sequence of ON/OFF observations, known as a *cadence*, with the `find_event_pipeline` and `plot_event_pipeline` functions that we've seen in other notebooks.\n",

    "The MeerKAT F engines channelize the antenna voltages into 1024, 4096, or 32768 frequency channels when running in \"1K\", \"4K\", and \"32K\" modes, resp.  A *zoom mode* also exists, but BLUSE does not utilize that because it offers less bandwidth (albeit at a higher resolution).  The MeerKAT L band receiver observes sky freqencies from 856 MHz to 1712 MHz (856 MHz bandwidth).  The MeerKAT UHF receiver observes sky frequencies from 544 MHz to 1088 MHz (544 MHz bandwidth).  \n",

    "### BLUSE channelization details\n",
    "\n",
    "The BLUSE backend will further channelize, aka *up-channelize*, the F engines' channelized antenna voltages.  Due to memory constraints, only a portion of the bandwidth is processed at one time.  The BLUSE backend loops over the input channels, always processing the same total bandwidth at each iteration.  The amount processed is 1 coarse channel in 1K mode, 4 coarse channels in 4K mode, and 32 coarse channels in 32K mode.  To keep the rest of the back end processing independent of the F engine mode, the up-channeliztion process always outputs the same number of fine channels, regardless of input mode.  The channelization details and resultant fine channel spectral resolutions are summarized in the following table.\n",

    "## Breakthrough Listen: Voyager 1 Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "[Voyager 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1) is the most distant man-made object from Earth. Launched by NASA in 1977, it has travelled at fantastic speed (roughly 17,000 m/s), past the outer boundaries of our Solar System and into interstellar space (>20 billion kilometers from the Sun).\n",
    "\n",
    "Remarkably, 38 years on, Voyager 1 is still sending telemetry data from the depths of interstellar space. This makes it a great systems test for the Breakthrough Listen signal processing pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we load, read, and plot some Breakthrough Listen (BL) observations of Voyager 1. The data were taken using the [Robert C. Byrd Greenbank Telescope](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/gbt) in West Virginia.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About this tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces you to BL filterbank data. It is intended for intermediate to advanced users, who have experience with Python, Numpy and basic astronomy. You'll need to have [Jupyter](http://www.jupyter.org) installed, along with a scientific Python installation (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and [astropy](http://www.astropy.org)).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the data\n",
    "\n",
    "We used the Greenbank X-band receiver (8.0-11.6 GHz) on December 30, 2015, to observe the known position of Voyager 1. The BL digital signal processing system saves digitized data in a 'raw' format, which we have converted into 'filterbank' format using our `gpuspec` code (see guppi2spectra.c in https://github.com/UCBerkeleySETI/gbt_seti/tree/master/src ). For *advanced users* who want to start from scratch, the specific command is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "time /gbt_seti/bin/gpuspec -i ./blc3_2bit_guppi_57386_VOYAGER1_0004.0000.raw \\\n",
    "    -B 2 -f 1032192 -t 15 -V -o /datax2/scratch/dprice/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this tutorial, we suggest that you download the 504 MB file [`voyager_f1032192_t300_v2.fil`](https://storage.googleapis.com/gbt_fil/voyager_f1032192_t300_v2.fil) from the BL data archive. There is also a [smaller file](https://github.com/UCBerkeleySETI/blimpy/blob/master/tests/Voyager_data/Voyager1.single_coarse.fine_res.fil) consisting of a subset of frequencies (corresponding to a single coarse channel) in the blimpy github distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Filterbank format \n",
    "\n",
    "The voyager data is stored in *filterbank format*, a simple binary file format that is detailed in the [SIGPROC user guide](http://sigproc.sourceforge.net/sigproc.pdf). For this tutorial, we've provided a simple Python class to load and interpret the filterbank file into a [numpy](http://www.numpy.org) array. "

    "If you've gotten this far, take a moment to pause and reflect. This faint signal has travelled billions of kilometers through space, back to us here on Earth. Launching this probe out of the Solar System was an immense feat, and the fact that we can detect it still, almost 40 years after its launch, is even more impressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The signals from probes such as Voyager are very different from the signals we measure from astrophysical objects. This is one of the approaches Breakthrough Listen is using in its approach toward detecting extraterrestrial signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope this tutorial has given you a glimpse into BL observations and data products. The next step, which will come in a later tutorial, is to calibrate these data into a more sensible unit, and to compensate for the Earth's rotation and the recessional velocity of Voyager. "
